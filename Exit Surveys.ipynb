    "**What the project is about:** In this project, I'll be working with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The DETE exit survey data can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",

    "**Goal of the project:** The purpose of this data analysis is to answer the following questions for a group of hypothetical stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for these institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? \n",
    "- What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer these questions, the stakeholders want me to combine the results for both surveys. "
