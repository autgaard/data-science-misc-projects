The main sources of revenue for this client are in-app ads, meaning that the number of users determines revenue for any given app â€” and the more users who see and engage with ads, the better.

**Goal of the project:** The goal for this project is to analyze data to help client's developers understand what type of ads are likely to attract more users.
